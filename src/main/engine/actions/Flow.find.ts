Passes control to the children, modifying their scope.

The pipeline should return a single element, which becomes the scope of the children
(this is also known as _scope inheritance_).

Note: every time the children are executed the scope is re-evaluated;
specifically, if scope element disappears (or some other pipeline failure occurs),
then children won't be able to execute.

### Parameters

- optional: if checked, the pipeline is allowed to return 0 elements in which case the action is bypassed
  (the children will not be entered), otherwise an error is thrown if pipeline returns 0 elements

### Use For

- restrict children to a specific fragment of the page
- provide children with common input data and input DOM node
- with optional, conditionally skip a number of actions if pipeline yields 0 elements
